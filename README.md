# Crop-Yield-Prediction

This repository contains code and resources for predicting crop yield using machine learning techniques.

# Overview

Crop yield prediction is a crucial task in agriculture that helps farmers and stakeholders make informed decisions regarding crop planning, resource allocation, and risk management. This project aims to predict crop yield based on various factors such as satellite imagery data, weather data, and soil information.

# Dataset
1. Satellite imagery data (Sentinel-2 bands)
2. Weather data (temperature, precipitation, etc.)
3. Soil information (soil type, moisture content, etc.)
4. Crop yield data

# Code Structure
1. crop_yield_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire workflow from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
2. requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies required to run the code.

# Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and merging relevant data sources.
2. Feature Engineering: Extracting meaningful features from satellite imagery (NDVI, EVI, NDWI, etc.) and other data.
3. Model Training: Training machine learning models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Neural Network) for yield prediction.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) score.
5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning the best performing model to improve accuracy.
6. Model Deployment: Deploying the final model for making predictions on new data.

# Future Improvements
1. Incorporate more advanced machine learning techniques such as ensemble methods and deep learning for improved accuracy.
2. Explore additional data sources such as historical crop yield data, pest/disease incidence, etc., for better insights.
3. Develop a web application or API for real-time crop yield prediction and visualization.
